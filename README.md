# Evaluating-ML-models

The purpose of this program is to evaluate different decision tree models from the python library sci-kit-learn (sklearn).

The data is obtained from OpenML using the id of the dataset in the url, and .fetch_openml().
The models and evaluations presented here are only possible with datasets that have a nominal target (binary or multiple) and numeric features. 
For the purpose of this exercise wind data from 1961 - 1978 was used, and the associated authors and paper from this dataset is attributed in the comments of the program.
